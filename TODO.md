# BioHome: Life Support for Deep Space - TODO List

## Project Progress Tracking

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x] Set up project structure with HTML, CSS, JS files and initialize GitHub repo

### 🔄 In Progress Tasks
- [ ] Research NASA data for realistic life support systems and space mission parameters

### 📋 Pending Tasks

#### Core Game Development
- [ ] Create all modular components (Algae, Hydroponics, Water Recycler, etc.) with pixel art
- [ ] Implement Earth build phase with drag-drop components and crew selection
- [ ] Build Mars journey simulation with real-time resource management
- [ ] Add A* pathfinding for crew dots with collision detection and space occupation

#### Game Systems
- [ ] Create random events system (solar flares, equipment failures, etc.)
- [ ] Add 5 bio-experiments system for win condition
- [ ] Add spacewalk mechanic for external repairs

#### UI/UX Features
- [ ] Create zoom controls, time acceleration, and interactive UI elements
- [ ] Implement crew dot movement with space occupation (2 people per spot, split left/right)

#### Backend Integration
- [ ] Integrate Supabase leaderboard with anonymous auth
- [ ] Set up database with provided password: nPfjcPnG4ccAql5D

#### Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Test performance, fix bugs, optimize for 60 FPS
- [ ] Deploy to Netlify and test live version

### 🎯 Current Focus
Working on implementing the complete game with all components and systems as specified in the instructions.

### 📝 Notes
- Using p5.js for graphics and simulations
- 8-bit pixel art style with zoom functionality
- Realistic NASA data for life support systems
- Variable time acceleration (1 real second = 1 simulated day)
- Continuous real-time resource decay
- 10-20% chance per simulated day for random events

### 🚀 Next Steps
1. Complete NASA data research
2. Implement all component types with proper pixel art
3. Add pathfinding system for crew movement
4. Integrate Supabase for leaderboard functionality
